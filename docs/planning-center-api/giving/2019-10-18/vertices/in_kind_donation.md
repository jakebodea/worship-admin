## Description

An `InKindDonation` record represents a non-cash gift given to an `Organization` at a specific time.

These include items like furniture, vehicles, services, or stocks. `InKindDonations` do not trigger
acknowledgment letter emails via the API — these must be sent from the Giving Admin UI.
